# AI Marine Water Impurity Detection and Contamination Analysis using OpenCV

This repository contains an AI-based application for detecting impurities and analyzing contamination in marine water using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). The project utilizes computer vision techniques to process images of marine water samples and identify potential impurities or contaminants.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for image manipulation, filtering, and analysis.
- **Impurity Detection**: Detects and highlights potential impurities in marine water samples.
- **Contamination Analysis**: Provides analysis and classification of contaminants based on image data.
- **User Interface**: Includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the application.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Capable of processing images in real-time for immediate feedback.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ai-marine-water-impurity.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. Use the GUI to load a marine water image or connect to a live camera feed.
3. Analyze the results displayed by the application, which will highlight detected impurities and provide contamination analysis.
